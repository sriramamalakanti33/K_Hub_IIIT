**K_Hub_IIIT**

This project is a basic example of a React frontend application that interacts with a Node.js backend API. The frontend allows users to select their dietary preference (vegetarian or non-vegetarian) and submits the data to the backend. The backend stores the data in a MongoDB database and returns the aggregated results back to the frontend, which is then visualized using a pie chart.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    * A MongoDB database running locally.

2. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sriramamalakanti33/K_Hub_IIIT.git
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
cd K_Hub_IIIT
npm install
```

4. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on port 5000 and the frontend development server. You can access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Explanation of Files**

* **cilent**
    * **src**
        * **components**
            * **index.js:** This file contains the React component that handles user input, submits data to the backend, and displays the pie chart.
* **server**
    * **db.js:** This file connects the application to the MongoDB database.
    * **index.js:** This file defines the backend API endpoints, including the `/add` endpoint that receives data from the frontend and stores it in the database.

**Readme Improvements**

* Consider adding instructions on how to set up a MongoDB database locally.
* You can mention additional features that could be implemented in the future, such as user authentication or more complex data visualization.
* Include a license file to specify the license under which the code is distributed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
